# Simple GitHub API Users Searching App
(built with create-react-app, Bootstrap & GitHub API)

## About

This app allows you to find & view any user's basic profile info & public repositories on GitHub!

## How to use this App?

Input the correct GitHub User username & you will see:

- user's current bio & location
- the number of user's open source projects (public repositories)
- user's projects' detailes: description, language & link to project's github pages if available or source code if not ;-)

### Note:

This is the newest version of the app.
Previous version (you can see the repo here: https://github.com/vadimgierko/GitHub-Users-Search-App) was built without using create-react-app.
Current version is built with create-react-app & gh-pages deployment.

All new functionality will be developed based on this version :-)
